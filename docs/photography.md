# Photography

I'm not an avid photographer by any means, but I have dabbled here and there. While I've uploaded a few photos to my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/james_photographs_stufff), I also have some a few categorised galleries below.

### Wishlist
- [ ] A [Tamron 150-600mm](https://www.tamron.eu/en-GB/p/5232717c-ce51-4f5b-8133-9d8b0668d6f8/sp-150-600mm-f5-63-di-vc-usd-g2) - Some zoom so that I'll finally have the reach to get some bird/raptor action shots.
- [ ] A [Laowa Macro Lens](https://www.venuslens.net/product/laowa-100mm-f-2-8-2x-macro-apo/?srsltid=AfmBOoqgo2InCxSufORVNXwv7PmRLgveGGZ_M5fcUnQk5SoLMY58V2Wd) - As to maintain auto-focus with better zoom and image quality over my current reverse lens solution.
